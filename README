The Orocos Real-Time Toolkit
============================

Quick Installation
==================

The Orocos RTT requires the 'cmake' program to be present, version
2.4.0 or later is recommended. http://www.cmake.org

Download the latest version from http://www.orocos.org/rtt

	tar -xvjf orocos-rtt-<version>-src.tar.bz2
	cd orocos-rtt-<version>
	mkdir build
	cd build
	../configure
	make
	make check
	make install

The installation manual can be found in the doc dir.  You can also
consult it online on the http://www.orocos.org website.


Configuring Orocos RTT
======================

Instead of '../configure', issue 'ccmake ..' from your build
directory.  The keys to use are 'arrows'/'enter' to modify a setting,
'c' to run a configuration check (may be required multiple times), 'g'
to generate the makefiles. If an additional configuration check is
required, the 'g' key can not be used and you must press 'c' and
examine the output.
