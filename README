The Open RObot COntrol Software (OROCOS) Framework
==================================================

After orocos-install.tcl
========================
If you got here after executing orocos-install.tcl,
source the orocosenv.sh scripts as told earlier,
then proceed with the build instructions as described
in the installation manual. For a quick start you can
do :

mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make new_packages
make configure_packages
make


General Instructions
====================

The installation manual can be found in the doc dir of 
this package (orocos-base). You can also consult it
online on the http://www.orocos.org website.

Each separate software package comes with its own
documentation in the common/doc dir. They are also
online consultable.

To check out the latest Orocos source with subversion,
use the following command :

svn co http://cvs.mech.kuleuven.ac.be/svn/orocos/orocos-trunk

The examples are in :

svn co http://cvs.mech.kuleuven.ac.be/svn/orocos/orocos-apps/kernel_sample
