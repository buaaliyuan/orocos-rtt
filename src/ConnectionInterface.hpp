    /**
     * An Object which manages and maintains a communication connection
     * between Ports.
     *
     * @par Creating a Connection
     * When connections are created, they are initially not connected,
     * and hence, no port 'knows' of this connection object. In order
     * to establish the connection between ports, call connect() explicitly on the newly created
     * connection object. As long as that does not happen, it only keeps
     * track of readers and writers, but does not connect them.
     *
     * @par Connection Management
     * A connection object has two states: connected() or !connected().
     * In both states, any number of readers and writers may subscribe
     * to this connection. If the state is !connected(), all subscribers
     * will only be connected when the connect() method is called.
     * If the state is connected(), every newly added subscriber is
     * directly connected to the connection.
     *
     * It is possible that a PortInterface participates in multiple
     * 'dormant' (ie !connected()) connections while only one connection
     *  is connected() at the same time. If one tries to connect() a
     * connection in which one ore more subscribers are already participating
     * in the connection, the connect() method fails.
     *
     * @par Reference counting
     * ConnectionInterface objects are reference counted. That means that
     * if no object holds a pointer to this object, it will be destroyed.
     * This can only happen if all ports disconnect from this connection.
     *
     * @par Thread Safety
     * Although this interface may be implemented thread-safe, the DataConnection
     * and BufferConnection classes have not been made thread-safe. This means that
     * multiple threads calling connect()/disconnect() on the same or related
     * connections may crash the system. Since connection setup is seen as
     * an application configuration step, executed by a single configurator,
     * Locking was not added. If this policy does not match your application setup,
     * write your own ConnectionInterface subclass, or submit a bug report.
     *
