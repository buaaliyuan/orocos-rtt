build highly configurable and interactive component-based real-time
control applications. You might use it to:

 * Control devices ranging from sensors to complete robots 
 * Capture and plot the data flows between components
 * Tune your algorithms at run-time
 * Write your controller as a hierarchical state machine
 * Interact with your devices directly from a GUI or command prompt
 * Extend it with your own data types
 * Configure components and the application from XML files
 * Extend your legacy control applications with all the above
 * Run it on standard operating systems as well as dedicated real-time
   systems

This release has improved how components can communicate over a
network, allowing to choose a communication protocol at runtime
instead of compile time. Also component compile times and memory footprints
have drastically improved. 
This release's major feature highlights are:

 * Components have been extended with an Error and Active state
 * Optional, 'hot' pluggable CORBA library for network communication
 * Timer class (and TimerComponent in OCL) for generating time based events
 * More efficient periodic task execution
 * Debian packages for Debian Etch at
   deb http://svn.fmtc.be/debian etch contrib

               The Orocos Real-Time Toolkit v1.0.0.
                       http://www.orocos.org
               ====================================

 The Orocos development team is proud to announce the first stable
 release of the Real-Time Toolkit (RTT), a C++ toolkit for building
 component based, real-time robotics and machine control applications.

 A new community website has been created in order to provide Orocos
 users a forum for collaboration and easier access to information.

 The website features also the releases of:

    * the 'Kinematics and Dynamics Library' (KDL) for calculating
    kinematic chains in real-time applications; 

    * the 'Orocos Components Library' (OCL) which offers components
    for hardware access (such as vision or force sensors), motion
    control and component management;

    * the 'Bayesian Filtering Library' (BFL) which provides an
    application independent framework for inference in Dynamic
    Bayesian Networks.

 The Real-Time Toolkit 1.0 allows rapid software component development
 and prototyping for control applications. Each component comes with
 built-in XML configuration, a real-time scripting interface, data
 ports for thread-safe data exchange and a user definable command
 interface. 

 The powerful Orocos 'TaskBrowser' component helps developers
 to run and debug their components, stand-alone or in a network and
 helps eliminating recompilation steps during development.
