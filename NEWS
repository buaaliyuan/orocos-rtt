OROCOS v0.22.0 Release Notes
   http://www.orocos.org
----------------------------

We announce the release of Orocos 0.22.0,
a framework for (realtime) robot, process and machine control.

This major feature release added the following projects to
the Orocos software:

 * Xenomai 2.0 Port
   http://www.xenomai.org

 * Control Kernel Process Component
   One can now redefine the order in which Components are run.

 * Control Kernel Kinematics Component
   A 'Process' Component which centralises kinematic calculations 
   and tracks the robot's kinematic state.

 * N-axis Kinematics
   Upgrade from the Kinematics interface from 6-degrees of 
   freedom kinematics to N-degrees of freedom.

 * Lock-free, real-time Events
   The event mechanism does no longer require the boost-signals library 
   and is now lock-free and hard real-time.

 * Event based (reactive) state machines
   The Orocos StateMachines can also change state on the 
   basis of Orocos events.

 * Data Flow ports for 'Task Contexts'.
   Defines a new Component model for Orocos.

OROCOS v0.20.0 Release Notes
   http://www.orocos.org
----------------------------

We announce the release of Orocos 0.20.0,
a framework for (realtime) robot, process and machine control.

This major feature release focussed on refactoring of the API,
validation and improvement of the realtime scripting language and
improvement of the overall realtime performance. The documentation has
been reordered to separate the 'Realtime Control Services' from the
'Robot Control Software'. Usability classes have been added to reduce
the 'red tape' code required to setup an Orocos application. This
is demonstrated by a new demo application ('taskintro') which is fully
interactive and is hardware independent.

Feature improvements, API changes, bugfixes and caveats can be found in :
  <http://www.orocos.org/releases/orocos-changes-0.20.0.html>

Orocos can be downloaded using this script :

OROCOS v0.18.0 Release Notes
   http://www.orocos.org
----------------------------

We announce the release of Orocos 0.18.0,
a framework for (realtime) robot, process and machine control

This major feature release introduces a 'task infrastructure' which allows 
application writers to design and implement realtime, multi-threaded units of 
functionality. A task's interface has attributes, methods, commands and 
events which can be exported to a high-level real-time scripting language.
Tasks within applications are online browsable and
can be manipulated interactively using the 'TaskBrowser'.
A real-time scripting language allows to write type- and thread-safe,
high-level programs using state machines or functional programming.

For Control Kernel users, a GUI ('kernelclient') was designed for
KDE 3 which allows to interact with the Control Kernel, directly
or using a CORBA interface. The latter allows to monitor multiple
Control Kernel Servers with one frontend.

Also, the installation process of Orocos has been streamlined and
the (html/pdf/ps) manuals had a layout and text review.

Feature improvements, bugfixes and caveats can be found in :
  <http://www.orocos.org/releases/orocos-changes-0.18.0.html>

Orocos can be downloaded using this script :
  <http://www.orocos.org/releases/orocos-install.tcl>
which is invoked as in :
  $ sh orocos-install.tcl

OROCOS v0.16.0 Release Notes
   http://www.orocos.org
----------------------------

We announce the release of Orocos 0.16.0, the Realtime
Framework for Robot and Machine Control. 

Thanks to an enthousiastic community, this release has
improved the functionality of Orocos significantly.
The Control Kernel Architecture has been revised to 
allow easier application development and a number of
ready-to-use control components is available
and documented. 

New Features compared to 0.14 are :

Overall Improvements :
 * Reduced compilation time and memory footprint
   of applications
 * Availability of the All-in-One Orocos Manual
 * Testing and bugfixes
 * Better support for RedHat/Fedora systems
 * Orocos compiles with GCC 3.4

Orocos Program Scripting :
 * Introduced if, while, for statements
 * Much more informative syntax error reporting
 * Added the Double6D type with index operator []

Orocos Control Kernel :
 * Simplified Control Architecture
 * Streamlined Documentation
 * Ready to use multi-channel Control Components
   for PID control, Axis positioning, Signal
   generation and hardware access.
 * Example for multi-axis control

Orocos Devices :
 * Matured Axis Implementation

User Interfacing :
 * Console Component with automatic
   command browsing and completion

Changes
-------

This release introduces some incompatibilities with
prior versions.

1a. The StandardControlKernel has changed that it only
   takes the Extension as a template parameter and
1b. Components have changed that they inherit directly
   from the Default-Component Base Classes without 
   using a template. See the control-kernel manual.
2. In scripting, a program script
   needs an extra *myname* identifier like a function,
   also the syntax has been extended. See the 
   program-parser manual.
3. The Axis implementation has changed. See 
   kernel_samples/axis_control and documentation
   for a new example.
4. Component selection is again allowed before
   the kernel is started, and an bool isSelected()
   method is provided in the base class.
5. The Channel_P_Controller has been renamed to P_Controller
   and PID_Controller has been added. Also, all 'channel'
   DataObjects have the name "ChannelValues" (also inputs).
6  In scripting, the 'kernel' and 'engine' components
   have been renamed to 'Kernel' and 'Execution'.

In general, if something changed, this change has
been documented in the manual.

which appeared a year ago. We switched to the eCos packaging
and configuration system to allow easy application-specific tweaking
and much of the code has been refactored. Thanks to the RTAI
community, Orocos delivers userspace realtime machine control
for Linux.
