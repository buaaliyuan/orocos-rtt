OROCOS v0.16.0 Release Notes
   http://www.orocos.org
----------------------------

We announce the release of Orocos 0.16.0, the Realtime
Framework for Robot and Machine Control. 

Thanks to an enthousiastic community, this release has
improved the functionality of Orocos significantly.
The Control Kernel Architecture has been revised to 
allow easier application development and a number of
ready-to-use control components is available
and documented. 

New Features compared to 0.14 are :

Overall Improvements :
 * Reduced compilation time and memory footprint
   of applications
 * Availability of the All-in-One Orocos Manual
 * Testing and bugfixes
 * Better support for RedHat/Fedora systems
 * Orocos compiles with GCC 3.4

Orocos Program Scripting :
 * Introduced if, while, for statements
 * Much more informative syntax error reporting
 * Added the Double6D type with index operator []

Orocos Control Kernel :
 * Simplified Control Architecture
 * Streamlined Documentation
 * Ready to use multi-channel Control Components
   for PID control, Axis positioning, Signal
   generation and hardware access.
 * Example for multi-axis control

Orocos Devices :
 * Matured Axis Implementation

User Interfacing :
 * Console Component with automatic
   command browsing and completion

Changes
-------

This release introduces some incompatibilities with
prior versions.

1a. The StandardControlKernel has changed that it only
   takes the Extension as a template parameter and
1b. Components have changed that they inherit directly
   from the Default-Component Base Classes without 
   using a template. See the control-kernel manual.
2. In scripting, a program script
   needs an extra *myname* identifier like a function,
   also the syntax has been extended. See the 
   program-parser manual.
3. The Axis implementation has changed. See 
   kernel_samples/axis_control and documentation
   for a new example.
4. Component selection is again allowed before
   the kernel is started, and an bool isSelected()
   method is provided in the base class.
5. The Channel_P_Controller has been renamed to P_Controller
   and PID_Controller has been added. Also, all 'channel'
   DataObjects have the name "ChannelValues" (also inputs).
6  In scripting, the 'kernel' and 'engine' components
   have been renamed to 'Kernel' and 'Execution'.

In general, if something changed, this change has
been documented in the manual.

OROCOS v0.14.2 Release Notes
   http://www.orocos.org
----------------------------

The Orocos bugfix release 0.14.2 covers two main issues on the 0.14
branch :

* All library code has changed to the LGPL License.
* Fix the MainThread.cxx LXRT compile issues
* All application code (like kernel_samples) states that it is
  covered by the GPL.
* 0.14.1 was not made public and only had the LGPL change.

* Updated documentation

OROCOS v0.12.0  Release Notes
   http://www.orocos.org
----------------------------

We announce the release of the Open RObot COntrol Software v0.12.0.

Orocos aims at building a community for designing realtime
open robot controllers using Free Software. This is a brief features
list of this release :

* The orocos-install.tcl scripts works more smoothly
* The Control Kernel documentation has been improved
* There are now 4 demonstration compile/run-ready sample kernels
* Runtime machine state descriptions added to the Program Parser and Processor
* The Program Parser and Processor have had much testing and documentation

OROCOS v0.10.0  Release Notes
   http://www.orocos.org
----------------------------

We announce the release of the Open RObot COntrol Software v0.10.0.

Orocos aims at building a community for designing realtime
open robot controllers using Free Software. This is a brief features
list of this release :

* eCos Package management system
* Graphical configuration tool (screenshots on the download page)
* Per package online manuals
* Various control kernel implementations (single, cascading, ...)
* Various 6D Path planning algorithms with VelocityProfiles
* State-full and State-less kinematic components
* Cartesian motion control components
* Synchronous/Asynchronous Event handling library
* Realtime Script Program processing
* Extendible Orocos Script Program parsing
* Runtime XML configuration of control kernels
* Runtime XML configuration of kernel components
* Extendible Reporting of control variables
* Complete cross-linked API documentation
* Explain by example online manuals.
* CANOpen support with CANPie integration
* Comedi integration
* Hardware Device interface abstractions
* Easy to use C++ Task-based multithreading
* Example applications for control kernels
* RTAI 24.1.x and 3.0 LXRT support
* Non-realtime GNU/Linux support

This release is tagged as STABLE. It has been tested on several
machines in our lab, such as a 6DOF Kuka Robot and XY positioning
machine.

This 0.10.0 release is a major step after the 0.9.0 release,
which appeared a year ago. We switched to the eCos packaging
and configuration system to allow easy application-specific tweaking
and much of the code has been refactored. Thanks to the RTAI
community, Orocos delivers userspace realtime machine control
for Linux.
