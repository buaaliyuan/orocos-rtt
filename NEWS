OROCOS v0.10.0  Release Notes
   http://www.orocos.org
----------------------------

We announce the release of the Open RObot COntrol Software v0.10.0.

Orocos aims at building a community for designing realtime
open robot controllers using Free Software. This is a brief features
list of this release :

* eCos Package management system
* Graphical configuration tool (screenshots on the download page)
* Per package online manuals
* Various control kernel implementations (single, cascading, ...)
* Various 6D Path planning algorithms with VelocityProfiles
* State-full and State-less kinematic components
* Cartesian motion control components
* Synchronous/Asynchronous Event handling library
* Realtime Script Program processing
* Extendible Orocos Script Program parsing
* Runtime XML configuration of control kernels
* Runtime XML configuration of kernel components
* Extendible Reporting of control variables
* Complete cross-linked API documentation
* Explain by example online manuals.
* CANOpen support with CANPie integration
* Comedi integration
* Hardware Device interface abstractions
* Easy to use C++ Task-based multithreading
* Example applications for control kernels
* RTAI 24.1.x and 3.0 LXRT support
* Non-realtime GNU/Linux support

This release is tagged as STABLE. It has been tested on several
machines in our lab, such as a 6DOF Kuka Robot and XY positioning
machine.

This 0.10.0 release is a major step after the 0.9.0 release,
which appeared a year ago. We switched to the eCos packaging
and configuration system to allow easy application-specific tweaking
and much of the code has been refactored. Thanks to the RTAI
community, Orocos delivers userspace realtime machine control
for Linux.
