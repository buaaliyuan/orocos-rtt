    This document provides a quick overview of what changed between
    the Real-Time Toolkit &oldversion; and version &version;. This
    release includes all bugfixes of the &oldversion; branch. If your
    application does not work, look here for possible causes and

      <title>Component network communication</title>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    From release 1.4.0 on, the decision if a component is accessible
	    over a network is no longer taken at compile time, but at runtime.
	    This is possible since the RTT has defined a 'plugin' API for
	    network communication. Moving this code to an external library
	    drastically improves compile time and  memory footprint of a
	    component.

      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    The <classname>RTT::TaskContext</classname> class has been
	    extended to support an InError state. A
	    component now has an <function>error()</function> and
	    <function>reset()</function> method to enter and leave the
	    InError state. If a component is in error, it will stop
	    running and refuse to start until it is reset(). Depending
	    upon implementation, a reset causes the component to enter
	    the PreOperational or Stopped state. The associated user
	    function (<function>resetHook()</function>) allow the user
	    to control that transition.

	    running and refuse to start until it is reset(). Depending
	    upon implementation, a reset causes the component to enter
	    the PreOperational or Stopped state. The associated user

	  <para>
	    From release 1.2.0 on, Orocos RTT has better build and run-time
	    support for Corba (using ACE/TAO). Remote modification of
	    component parameters has been improved and is taken advantage
	    of by the Corba based KTaskbrowser 1.2.
