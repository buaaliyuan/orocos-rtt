    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      This manual documents how multi-threaded components can be
      defined in &orocos; such that they form a thread-safe
      robotics/machine control application.  Each control component is
      defined as a "TaskContext", which defines the environment or
      "context" in which an application specific task is executed. The
      context is described by the five Orocos primitives: Event, Property,
      Command, Method and Data Port. This document defines how a user
      can write his own task context and how it can be used in an
      application.

    <para>
      A component is a basic unit of functionality which executes one or
      more (real-time) programs in a single thread.  The program can
      vary from a mere C function over a real-time program script to a
      real-time hierarchical state machine. The focus is completely on
      thread-safe time determinism. Meaning, that the system is free
      of priority-inversions, and all operations are lock-free (also
      data sharing and other forms of communication such as events and
      commands).  Real-time components can communicate with non real-time
      components (and vice verse) transparently.

	In this manual, the words task and component are used as equal
	words, meaning a software component built using the C++

      <title>Setting up the TaskBrowser</title>
      <para>
	The way we interact with TaskContexts during development of an
	Orocos application is through the <emphasis>Task
	Browser</emphasis>.  The
	<classname>OCL::TaskBrowser</classname> is a powerful console
	tool which helps you to explore, execute and debug
	<classname>RTT::TaskContext</classname>s in running
	programs. All you have to do is to create a TaskBrowser and
	call its loop() method. When the program is started from a
	console, the TaskBrowser takes over user input and output.
	The TaskBrowser uses the GNU readline library to easily enter
	commands to the tasks in your system. This means you can press
	TAB to complete your commands or press the up arrow to scroll
	through previous commands. 
      </para>
      <note>

	  The <classname>OCL::TaskBrowser</classname> is a component
	  of its own which is found in the Orocos Component Library (OCL).

	configured to display informative messages to
	console. Normally, only warnings or worse are displayed by
	Orocos. You can always watch the log file 'orocos.log' in the
	same directory to see all messages.  After the <command>[Log
	Level]</command>, the <command>[Origin]</command> of the
	message is printed, and finally the message itself. These
	messages leave a trace of what was going on in the main()
	function before the prompt appeared.

      <para>
	Depending on what you type, the TaskBrowser will act
	differently.  The built-in commands <command>cd</command>,
	<command>help</command>, <command>quit</command> and
	<command>ls</command> are seen as commands to the TaskBrowser
	itself, if you typed something else, it tries to evaluate your
	command to an expression and will print the result to the
	console. If you did not type an expression, it tries to parse
	it as a command to a (peer) task. If that also fails, it means
	you made a typo and it prints the syntax error to console.

      </note>
      <para>
	First you get a list of the Properties and Attributes
	(alphabetical) of the current component. Properties are meant
	for configuration and can be written to disk. Attributes are
	solely for run-time values. Each of them can be changed
	(except constants.)
      </para>
      <para>
	Next, the interface of this component is listed: One method is
	present <emphasis>the_method</emphasis>, one command
	<emphasis>the_command</emphasis> and one event
	<emphasis>the_event</emphasis>. They all print a 'Hello World'
	string when invoked.
      </para>
      <para>
	In the example, the current task has only three objects:
	<emphasis>this</emphasis>, <emphasis>the_data_port</emphasis>
	and <emphasis>the_buffer_port</emphasis>. The
	<emphasis>this</emphasis> object serves as the public
	interface of the Hello component. These objects contain
	methods, commands or events.  The
	<emphasis>the_data_port</emphasis> and
	<emphasis>the_buffer_port</emphasis> objects are created to
	represent the data ports of the Hello component. They allow
	you to to send or receive data to these ports and check if
	they are connected.
      </para>
      <para>
	Last, the peers are shown, that is, the components which are
	known, and may be used, by this component. The
	<classname>OCL::HelloWorld</classname> component is a
	stand-alone component and has only the TaskBrowser as a peer.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Listing the Interface</title>
      <para>
	To get a list of the Task's interface, you can
	always type an object name, for example <emphasis>this</emphasis>.
      </para>
      <screen>
 In Task Hello. (Status of last Command : none )
 (type 'ls' for context info) : <command>this</command>
      Got :this

Printing Interface of 'Hello' :

  Command    : bool <emphasis>the_command</emphasis>( string the_arg )
   Hello Command Description
   the_arg : Use 'World' as argument to make the command succeed.
  Method     : string <emphasis>the_method</emphasis>( )
   Hello Method Description
  Event     : void <emphasis>the_Event</emphasis>( string the_data )
   Hello Event Description
   the_data : The data of this event.
      </screen>
      <para>
	Now we get more details about the commands, methods and
	events registered in the public interface. We see now that
	the <emphasis>the_command</emphasis> command takes one argument
	as a string, or that the <emphasis>the_method</emphasis> method
	returns a string. One can invoke each one of them.
    </para>

      Got :the_method()
 = <command>Hello World</command>
      </screen>
      <para>
	Methods are called directly and the TaskBrowser prints the
	result. The return value of the_method() was a string, which is
	"Hello World". This works just like calling a 'C' function.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Sending a Command</title>
      <para>
	When a command is entered, it is <emphasis>sent</emphasis> to
	the Hello component, which will execute it in its own threadon
	behalf of the sender. The different stages of its lifetime are
	displayed by the prompt. Hitting enter will refresh the status
	line:

    <section>
      <title>Changing Values</title>
      <para>
	Besides sending commands to tasks, you can alter the
	attributes of any task, program or state machine. The
	TaskBrowser will confirm validity of the assignment with
	'true' or 'false' :
      </para>
      <screen>
 In Task Hello. (Status of last Command : none )
 (type 'ls' for context info) :<command>the_attribute</command>
      Got :the_attribute
 = <command>Hello World</command>
 In Task Hello. (Status of last Command : none )
 (type 'ls' for context info) :<command>the_attribute = "Veni Vidi Vici !"</command>
      Got :the_attribute = "Veni Vidi Vici !"
 = <command>true</command>

 In Task Hello. (Status of last Command : none )
 (type 'ls' for context info) :<command>the_attribute</command>
      Got :the_attribute
 = <command>Veni Vidi Vici !</command>
      </screen>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Emiting Events</title>
      <para>
	Finally, let's emit an Event. The Hello World Event requires a
	payload. A callback handler was registered by the component,
	thus when we emit it, it can react to it:
      </para>
      <screen>
 In Task Hello. (Status of last Command : none )
 (type 'ls' for context info) :<command>the_event(the_attribute)</command>
      Got :the_event(the_attribute)
 = <command>true</command>
 In Task Hello. (Status of last Command : none )
 (type 'ls' for context info) :
<command>354.592 [ Info   ][Hello] Receiving Event: Veni Vidi Vici !</command>
      </screen>
      <para>
	The example above passed the the_attribute object as an
	argument to the event, and it was received by our task correctly.
	Events are related to commands, but allow broadcasting of
	data, while a command has a designated receiver.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Reading and Writing Data Ports</title>
      <para>
	The Data Ports can be accessed through the
	<emphasis>the_data_port</emphasis> and
	<emphasis>the_buffer_port</emphasis> object interfaces. 
      </para>
      <para>
	Initially, these ports are unconnected, as the HelloWorld
	component did not connect its ports to another component.
	Unconnected ports can hardly be used. In order to test them,
	you can instruct the TaskBrowser to connect to them. This is
	done by entering the <command>.connect</command> command (note
	the '.'). 
      </para>
      <para>
	Since each port has an associated object, we can inspect the
	interface of a port by typing its name:
      </para>
      <screen>
 In Task Hello. (Status of last Command : none )
 (type 'ls' for context info) :<command>the_data_port</command>
      Got :the_data_port

Printing Interface of 'the_data_port' :

  Method     : string <emphasis>Get</emphasis>( )
   Get the current value of this Data Port
  Method     : void <emphasis>Set</emphasis>( string const&amp; <emphasis>Value</emphasis> )
   Set the current value of this Data Port
   Value : The new value.
      </screen>
      <para>
	The the_data_port object has two methods: Get() and Set().
	Since data ports are used for sending unbuffered data packets
	between components, this makes sense. One can interact with
	the ports as such:
      </para>
      <screen>
 In Task Hello. (Status of last Command : none )
 (type 'ls' for context info) :<command>the_data_port.Set("World")</command>
      Got :the_data_port.Set("World")
 = <command>(void)</command>

 In Task Hello. (Status of last Command : none )
 (type 'ls' for context info) :<command>the_data_port.Get()</command>
      Got :the_data_port.Get()
 = <command>World</command>
      </screen>
      <para>
	When a value is Set(), it is sent to whatever is connected to
	that port, when we read the port using Get(), we see that the
	previously set value is present. The advantage of using ports

      <title>Error States Example</title>
      <para>
	Here is a very simple use case, a TaskContext communicates over
	a socket with a remote device. Normally, we get a data packet
	every 10ms, but sometimes one may be missing. This is signaled
	as a run time warning, but we just continue. When we don't
	receive 5 packets in a row, we signal this as a run time
	error. From the moment packets come in again we go back to run
	time warning. Now if the data we get is corrupt, we go into
	fatal error mode, as we have no idea what the current state of
	the remote device is, and shouldn't be updating our state, as
	no one can rely on the correct functioning of the TaskContext.
      </para>
      <para>
	Here's the pseudo code:
	<programlisting> class MyComponent : public TaskContext
 {
       int faults;
 public:
       MyComponent(const std::string &amp;name) 
         : TaskContext(name), faults(0) 
       {}

 protected:
       // Read data from a buffer.
       // If ok, process data, otherwise, trigger
       // a runtime warning. When to many faults occur,
       // trigger a runtime error.
       void updateHook()
       {
            Data_t data;
            bool rv = mybuf.Pop( data );
            if ( rv ) {
               this->stateUpdate(data);
               faults = 0;
            } else {
               faults++;
               if (faults > 4)
                   this->error();
               else
                   this->warning();
            }

       }

       // Called instead of updateHook() when in runtime error state.
       void errorHook()
       {
            this->updateHook(); // just call updateHook anyway.
       }

       // Called by updateHook()
       void stateUpdate(Data_t data)
       {
            // Check for corrupt data
            if ( checkData(data) == -1 ) {
                 this->fatalError(); // we will enter the FatalError state.
            } else {
                 // data is ok: update internal state...
            }
       }
 };</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	Finally, you start this component with a NonPeriodicActivity,
	which allows you to wait in updateHook() for as long as you
	want. Commands and events are processed when you leave the
	function, that's why you can not use a while(1) {} loop within
	updateHook(), but re-trigger the activity again for a next
	run.
      </para>
      <para>
	When you want to discard the 'warning' state of the component,
	call mycomp.recovered().  If your component went into
	FatalError, call mycomp.reset() and mycomp.start() again for
	processing updateHook() again.

      <para>
	The Orocos Data Flow is implemented with the
	<emphasis>Port-Connector</emphasis> software pattern. Each
	task defines its data exchange ports and inter-task connectors
	transmit data from one port to another. A Port is defined by a
	name, unique within that task, the data type it wants to
	exchange and the buffered or un-buffered method of exchanging.
	Buffered exchange is done by "Buffer" Ports and un-buffered
	exchange is done by "Data" Ports.
      </para>
      <para>
	A Data Port can offer read-only, write-only or read-write access
	to the unbuffered data. A Buffer Port can offer read-only,
	write-only and read-write access to the buffered data.
	The example below shows all these possibilities.

      <para>
	The example starts with declaring all the ports of MyTask. A
	template parameter '&lt;double&gt;' specifies the type of data
	the task wants to exchange through that port. Logically, if
	two tasks are connected, they must agree on this type.  The
	constructor of MyTask initialises each port with a name.  This
	name is used to 'match' ports between connected tasks
	( using 'connectPorts', see <xref linkend="connect-tasks" /> ),
	but it is possible to connect Ports with different names as well.
      </para>
      <para>
	Write and read-write Buffers take besides a name, the prefered
	buffer size as a parameter. In the example, these are the
	values 15 and 30. Before the task is connected to its peers,
	you can still change this value with the
	<function>setBufferSize()</function> function of the Port, for
	example in the <function>configureHook()</function> function
	of your TaskContext.
      </para>
      <para>
	Finally, a 'write' port can take an initial value in the
	constructor as well. This value will be used when the connection
	between two ports is created in order to initialise the connection
	( using 'connectPorts', see <xref linkend="connect-tasks" /> ).
	If a 'write' port is connected to an existing connection, the
	initial value (and buffer size) are ignored and the settings of
	the existing connection are not touched. You can modify the
	initial value with the 'Set( value )' function in both Buffer
	and Data write ports.
      </para>
      <note>
	<para>
	  Alternatively, you can connect buffers in your
	  main() program by writing:
	  <programlisting>  #include &lt;rtt/ConnectionFactory.hpp&gt;
  // ...
  int buf_size = 100;
  <classname>RTT::ConnectionFactory</classname>&lt;double&gt; cf;
  <classname>RTT::ConnectionInterface</classname>::shared_ptr con =
    cf.createBuffer(a_task->ports()->getPort("SetPoint_X"), 
                    b_task->ports()->getPort("SetPoint_X"), 
                    buf_size);
  if (con)
     con->connect();</programlisting>
	<emphasis>before</emphasis> the tasks are connected. 
	This connection will then take precedence.

	  At this point, the task start up can still be aborted by
	  returning false. Otherwise, a write to a port
	  will be discarded, while a read returns the initial value
	  or the default value. A Pop of a disconnected port will

	<title>Using Data Flow in Scripts</title>
	<para>
	  When a Port is connected, it becomes available to the
	  Orocos scripting system such that (part of) the calculation
	  can happen in a script. Also, the TaskBrowser can then
	  be used to inspect the contents of the DataFlow on-line.
	</para>
	<para>
	  A small program script could be loaded into MyTask with
	  the following contents:
	  <programlisting>  program MyControlProgram {
    double the_K  = K        // read task property, see later.
    double setp_d

    while ( true ) {
      if ( SetPoint_X.Pop( setp_d ) ) { // read Buffer Port
        double in_d = Data_R.Get()      // read Data Port
        double out_d = (setp_d - in_d) * K  // Calculate
        do Data_W.Set( out_d )          // write Data Port
      }
      do nothing       // this is a 'wait' point.
    }
  } </programlisting>
         The program "MyControlProgram" starts with declaring
	 two variables and reading the task's Property 'K'.
	 Then it goes into an endless loop, trying to Pop
	 a set point value from the "SetPoint_X" Buffer Port. If that succeeds (buffer not empty)
	 the  "Data_R" Data Port is read and a simple 
	 calculation is done. The result is written to the
	 "Data_W" Data Port and can now be read by the other
	 end. Alternatively, the result may be directly
	 used by the Task in order to write it to a device
	 or any non-task object. You can use methods (below)
	 to send data from scripts back to the C++ implementation.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Remark that the program is executed within the Execution
	  Engine. In order to avoid the endless loop, a 'wait' point
	  must be present. The "do nothing" command inserts such a
	  wait point and is part of the Scripting syntax.  If you plan
	  to use Scripting state machines, such a
	  <function>while(true)</function> loop (and hence wait point)
	  is not necessary. See the Scripting Manual for a full
	  overview of the syntax.

      <para>
	The easiest way to access a TaskContext's interface
	is through Methods. They resemble very much normal C
	or C++ functions, but they have the advantage to be
	usable in scripting or can be called over a network
	connection. They take arguments and return a value.
	The return value can in return be used as an argument
	for other Methods or stored in a variable. For
	all details, we refer to the &orocos; Scripting
	Manual.
      </para>
      <para>
	To add a TaskContext's method to the method interface, one 
	proceeds similarly as when creating Data Ports. The
	data type is now replaced by a <emphasis>function signature</emphasis>,
	for example '<programlisting>void(int, double)</programlisting>'
	which is the signature of a function returning 'void' and
	having two arguments: an 'int' and a 'double'.

      </para>
      <para>
	In the above example, we wish to add 3 class functions to the
	method interface: reset, getName and changeParameter. This can
	be done by constructing a
	<classname>RTT::Method</classname> object with the
	correct function signature for each such class function.  Each
	Method object is initialised in the constructor with a name
	(&quot;reset&quot;), a pointer to the class function
	(&amp;MyTask::reset) and a pointer to the class object (this).
	This setup allows the method objects resetMethod, nameMethod
	and paramMethod to be invoked just like one would call the
	functions directly.
      </para>
      <para>
	After the method objects are constructed, we add methods to
	the method interface using the addMethod() function.  The
	addMethod() function requires a a method object (&amp;resetMethod),
	a description (&quot;Reset the system.&quot;) and a name,
	description pair for each argument (such as in
	changeParameter).
      </para>
      <para>
	Using this mechanism, any method of <emphasis>any</emphasis>
	class can be added to a task's method interface.

	<title>Invoking Methods in C++</title>

       <para>
	 Up to 4 arguments can be given. If the signature was

    <para>
      A TaskContext may have any number of attributes or properties,
      of any type. They can be used by programs in the
      TaskContext to get (and set) configuration data.
      The task allows to store any C++ value type and
      also knows how to handle Property objects. Attributes are plain
      variables, while properties can be written to and updated from an XML file.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>Adding Task Attributes or Properties</title>
      <para>
	An attribute can be added in the task's interface
	(<classname>RTT::AttributeRepository</classname>) like this :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>  #include &lt;rtt/Property.hpp>
  #include &lt;rtt/Attribute.hpp>

  class MyTask
    : public <classname>RTT::TaskContext</classname>
  {
     <classname>RTT::Attribute</classname>&lt;bool&gt; aflag;
     <classname>RTT::Attribute</classname>&lt;int&gt; max;

     <classname>RTT::Constant</classname>&lt;double&gt; pi;

     <classname>RTT::Property</classname>&lt;std::string&gt; param;
     <classname>RTT::Property</classname>&lt;double&gt; value;
  public:
    // ...
    MyTask(std::string name)
      : <classname>RTT::TaskContext</classname>(name),
        param("Param","Param Description","The String"),
	value("Value","Value Description", 1.23 ),
	aflag("aflag", false),
	max( "max", 5 ),
	pi( "pi", 3.14 )
    {
       // other code here...

       this->attributes()->addAttribute( &amp;aflag );

       this->properties()->addProperty( &amp;param );
       this->properties()->addProperty( &amp;value );
     }
     // ...
  };
</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	Which inserts an attribute of type bool and int, name 'aflag' and 'max' and initial
	value of false and 5 to the task's interface. A constant 'pi' is added as well.
	The methods return false if an attribute with that name already exists.
	Adding a Property is also straightforward. The property is added in a 
	<classname>RTT::PropertyBag</classname>.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Accessing Task Attributes or Properties in C++</title>
      <para>
	To get a value from the task, you can use the set() and get() methods :
      </para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  bool result = aflag.get();
  assert( result == false );

  param.set("New String");
  assert( param.get() == "New String" );</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	While another task can access it through the attributes() interface:
    <programlisting>  Attribute&lt;bool> the_flag = a_task->attributes()->getAttribute&lt;bool>("aflag");
  assert( the_flag.ready() );

  bool result = the_flag.get();
  assert( result == false );

  Attribute&lt;int> the_max = a_task->attributes()->getAttribute&lt;int>("max");
  assert( the_max.ready() );
  the_max.set( 10 );
  assert( the_max.get() == 10 );</programlisting>
  The attributes 'the_flag' and 'the_max' are called 'mirrors' of the
  original attributes of the task.

  var int    myMax = 3
  set ATask.max = myMax	</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	When trying to assign a value to a constant, the script parser
	will throw an exception, thus before the program is run.
	You must always specify the task's name (or 'task') when accessing a
	task's attribute, this is different from methods and commands,

	the task.

	Analogous to the event example in the CoreLib reference

	a class funcion is made to react to the event. A connection
	is setup between the "move" event and the <function>react_callback</function>
	function of "r". The connection can be controlled using
	the handle to connect or disconnect the reaction to events.
	When <function>connect()</function> is called, every

	with the given arguments. Using a 'C' function works analogous as shown

	A second example continues, but uses an asynchronous connection.
	First a new task (b_task) is created which will handle the event

      <title>Setting up the Data Flow</title>
      <para>
	Data Flow between TaskContexts is setup by using <function>connectPorts</function>.
	The direction of the data flow is imposed by the read/write direction of
	the ports.  The <function>connectPorts(TaskContext* A, TaskContext* B)</function> function
	creates a connection between TaskContext ports when both ports 
	have the same name and type. It will never disconnect existing connections
	and only tries to add ports to existing connections or create new
	connections.
      </para>
      <para>
	Before calling <function>connectPorts</function>, one may connect
	individual ports using <function>a_port.connectTo(&amp;b_port);</function>
	when complexer data flow networks need to be formed.
    </para>
    <example><title>TaskContext Data Flow Topology Example</title>
    <para>This diagram shows some possible topologies. Four tasks,
    "A", "B", "C" and "D" have each a port "MyData" and a port "MyData2".
    The example demonstrates that connections are always made from
    writer (sender) to reader (receiver).

    <para>
      The first network has two writers and two readers for "MyData".
      It can be formed starting from "A" and adding "B","C"
      and "D" as peers of "A" respectively. Since the network started from
      "A" all peers share the same connection. The same network could have
      been formed starting from "B". The second diagram connects
      "A" to "C" and then "B" to "D". Two connections are now made and if
      the application tries to connect "B" to "C", this will fail since
      the "MyData" Port of "C" already participates in a connection.
    </para>
    <para>
      The third network has one writer and three readers for "MyData2".
      It can now only be formed starting from "D" and adding "A","B" and "C"
      as peers to "D". Combining both network one and three is possible
      by merely invoking all the 'addPeer' methods in the correct order.
    </para>
    </example>
    <para>
      <function>connectPorts</function> tries to create connections in
      both directions. If a task's Port already has a connection, any
      task with compatible, unconnected ports will be added to that
      connection.  For example, if "a_task" and "b_task" exchange a
      Data type "Data_X", and "c_task" reads "Data_X", the
      <function>connectPorts</function> will forward "Data_X" to "c_task"

    <section><title>Disconnecting Tasks</title>
    <para>
      Tasks can be disconnected from a network by invoking

      disconnect all its ports. This does not mean that
      all data flow connections are deleted. As long as one task's
      port still participates in a connection, the connections
      exist. When the last port disconnects, the data flow connection
      is cleaned up as well.

	as public class members in a TaskCore subclass. Each
	component that wants to use this TaskCore must get a

      <programlisting>  commands()->add<emphasis>Command</emphasis>(&amp;com, "Description", "Arg1","Arg1 Description",...);</programlisting>
      <para>

      </para>
      <programlisting>  commands()->add<emphasis>Command</emphasis>( &amp;com );</programlisting>
      <para>
	This is no more than a pointer registration, but already allows

    <title>Advanced Techniques</title>
    <para>
      If you master the above methods of setting up tasks, this section
      gives some advanced uses for integrating your existing application
      framework in Orocos Tasks.
    </para>
    <section>
      <title>Using the <classname>TaskContext</classname></title>
      <para>
	To help users in setting up quickly a TaskContext, the
	TaskContext class has been made available which adds some
	standard methods and commands to its interface which are
	common to many tasks. It supports loading Programs and
	StateMachines, saving Properties to disk and reading them back
	in and stopping and starting the Task.  You can download an
	introduction to setting up TaskContexts which uses this class
	from the 'task-intro' RTT example on the <ulink
	url="http://www.orocos.org/rtt/source">RTT Source code</ulink>
	page of the Orocos.org website.
      </para>

    <section>
      <title>Wrapping Methods in Functions</title>
      <para>
	Methods are always executed in the thread of the caller. If a 
	method does non-real-time operations, like writing data to disk, 
	it should not be called by a real-time thread. However, if the
	thread which owns the method is itself not real-time, it can execute
	the method as a command in its own thread. This can easily be
	accomplished by writing a wrapper function ( or alternatively, 
	register the method as a command too ).
      </para>
      <programlisting>  export function domethod( int arg ) {
     do mymethod( arg )
  } </programlisting>
      <para>
	Load this function with the <classname>RTT::ProgramLoader</classname>
	in the TaskContext having 'mymethod', and hard real-time tasks
	can instruct it to execute that method, without jeopardizing 
	their own real-time behaviour.
      </para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Waiting for Something : Synchronisation</title>
      <para>
	When tasks need to synchronise, you have a wide range of
	options to use. 
      </para>
      <section>
	<title>Waiting in States</title>
	<para>
	  A (sub-)State Machine can pause itself and an extra function
	  in the task's interface can provide the key to progress to
	  another state. First the StateMachine is loaded in an .osd file  :
	</para>
	<programlisting>
  StateMachine X {
     // ...
     state y {
        entry {
           // pause myself, no transitions are checked.
           do this.pause()
        }
        transitions {
	   // guard this transition.
           if checkSomeCondition() then
              select z
        }
     }
     state z {
       // ...
     }
  }

  RootMachine X x</programlisting>
	<para>Then, load an ops file which contains :</para>
	<programlisting>
  export function progress() {
    // Check if we may progress :
    if this.x.inState("y") then {
        // continue :
        do this.x.start()
        // OR try single transition :
        do this.x.step()
    }
  }</programlisting>
	<para>
	  A peer task then calls <function>progress()</function>
	  which in turn checks if the function is applicable.
	  But even then, the responsibility of the transition
	  lies within the State Machine.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Of course, the example can be simplified by setting/
	  resetting a boolean flag between function and
	  State Machine.
	</para>
	<programlisting>
  StateMachine X {
     // ...
     state y {
        transitions {
           if progressflag == true then
                select z
        }
     }
     state z {
       // ...
     }
  }

  RootMachine X x</programlisting>
	<para>Then, load an ops file which contains :</para>
	<programlisting>
  export function progress() {
    // Check if we may progress :
    if this.x.inState("y") then {
          set progressflag = true
    }
  }</programlisting>
	<para>
	  When the user or another program calls the progress() command,
	  the flag will be set.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Requesting States</title>
	<para>
	  A State Machine can be used such that it waits for state
	  change requests instead of discovering itself to which 
	  state it makes a transition. This requires the State Machine to run in
	  another mode, the requestState mode ( as opposed to the automatic mode,
	  which is entered by start() ). 
	</para>
	<programlisting>
  StateMachine X {
     // ...
     state y {
        entry {
	   // ...
        }
        transitions {
	   // guard this transition.
           if checkSomeCondition() then
              select z
	   // always good to go to states :
	   select ok_1
           select ok_2
        }
     }
     state z {
       // ...
     }
     state ok_1 {
       // ...
     }
     state ok_2 {
       // ...
     }
  }

  RootMachine X x</programlisting>
	<para>Then, load an ops file which contains :</para>
	<programlisting>
  export function progress() {
       // request to enter anther state :
       do this.x.requestState("z")
    }
  export function progress_Ok() {
       // this will succeed always from state 'x' :
       do this.x.requestState("ok1")
    } </programlisting>
         <para>
	   This command will fail if the transition is not 
	   possible ( for example, the state machine is not in
	   state y, or checkSomeCondition() was not true ),
	   otherwise, the state machine will make the transition
	   and the command succeeds and completes when the z state
	   is fully entered (it's init program completed).
	 </para>
	 <para>
	   To merely request that a state is handled, one can
	   call requestState on the current state :
	 </para>
	<programlisting>
  export function handleState() {
       // request to handle current state :
       do this.x.requestState( this.x.getState() )
    }  </programlisting>
	 <para>
	   To request to go to the next possible state (or call handle if
	   none) and then wait again for requests, use 'step()' :
	 </para>
	<programlisting>
  export function evaluate() {
       // request go to the next state and wait :
       do this.x.step()
    }  </programlisting>
         <para>
	   Note that if the StateMachine happened to be paused, step() would
	   only progress one single statement. To check if the StateMachine
	   is waiting for requests, use the 'inRequest()' method :
	 </para>
	<programlisting>
  export function progress() {
       if ( this.x.inRequest() ) {
           // ... it's waiting
       } else {
          // was not waiting, possibly running, paused or non active
       }
    }  </programlisting>
        <para>
	  All these methods can of course also be called from parent
	  to child State Machine, or across tasks.
	</para>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Polymorphism : Task Interfaces</title>
      <para>
	Most projects have define their own task interfaces in C++.
	Assume you have a class with the following interface :
      </para>
      <programlisting>
  class DeviceInterface
  {
  public:
    /**
     * Set/Get a parameter. Returns false if parameter is read-only.
     */
    virtual bool setParameter(int parnr, double value) = 0;
    virtual double getParameter(int parnr) const = 0;

    /**
     * Get the newest data.
     * Return false on error.
     */
    virtual bool updateData() = 0;
    virtual bool updated() const = 0;

    /**
     * Get Errors if any.
     */
    virtual int getError() const = 0;
  };</programlisting>
      <para>
	Now suppose you want to do make this interface available,
	such that program scripts of other tasks can access this 
	interface. Because you have many devices, you surely want
	all of them to be accessed transparently from a supervising
	task. Luckily for you, C++ polymorphism can be transparently
	adopted in Orocos TaskContexts. This is how it goes.
      </para>
      <section>
	<title>Step 1 : Export the interface</title>
	<para>We construct a TaskContext, which exports your
	C++ interface to a task's interface.
	</para>
	<programlisting>
  #include &lt;rtt/TaskContext.hpp&gt;
  #include &lt;rtt/Command.hpp&gt;
  #include &lt;rtt/Method.hpp&gt;
  #include "DeviceInterface.hpp"

  class TaskDeviceInterface
    : public DeviceInterface,
      public <classname>RTT::TaskContext</classname>
  {
  public:
      TaskDeviceInterface()
        : <classname>RTT::TaskContext</classname>( "DeviceInterface" )
      {
         this->setup();
      }

      void setup() 
      {
         // Add Methods :
         this->methods()-&gt;addMethod(method(&quot;setParameter&quot;,
                    &amp;DeviceInterface::setParameter, this),
	                   &quot;Set a device parameter.&quot;,
	                   &quot;Parameter&quot;, &quot;The number of the parameter.&quot;,
	                   &quot;New Value&quot;, &quot;The new value for the parameter.&quot;); 

         this->methods()-&gt;addMethod(method(&quot;getParameter&quot;,
                     &amp;DeviceInterface::getParameter, this),
	                  &quot;Get a device parameter.&quot;,
                          &quot;Parameter&quot;, &quot;The number of the parameter.&quot;);
         this->methods()-&gt;addMethod(method(&quot;getError&quot;,
                     &amp;DeviceInterface::getError, this),
	                 &quot;Get device error status.&quot;);

         // Add Commands :
         this->commands()-&gt;addCommand(method(&quot;updateData&quot;,
                          &amp;DeviceInterface::updateData, this),
                                 &amp;DeviceInterface::updated,
                                 &quot;Command data acquisition.&quot; );
      }
  };</programlisting>
	<para>
	  The above listing just combines all operations which were introduced
	  in the previous sections. Also note that the TaskContext's name
	  is fixed to "DeviceInterface". This is not obligatory though.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Step 2 : Inherit from the new interface</title>
	<para>Your DeviceInterface implementations now
	  only need to inherit from <classname>TaskDeviceInterface</classname>
	  to instantiate a Device TaskContext :
	</para>
	<programlisting>
  #include "TaskDeviceInterface.hpp"

  class MyDevice_1 
    : public TaskDeviceInterface
  {
  public:

    bool setParameter(int parnr, double value) {
      // ...
    }
    double getParameter(int parnr) const {      // ...
    }
    // etc.
  };
	</programlisting>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Step 3 : Add the task to other tasks</title>
	<para>
	  The new TaskContext can now be added to other tasks.
	  If needed, an alias can be given such that the
	  peer task knows this task under another name.
	  This allows the user to access different incarnations
	  of the same interface from a task.
	</para>
	<programlisting>
	  // now add it to the supervising task :
  MyDevice_1 mydev;
  supervisor.addPeer( &amp;mydev, "device" );
	</programlisting>
	<para>
	  From now on, the "supervisor" task will be able to access
	  "device". If the implementation changes, the same interface
	  can be reused without changing the programs in the supervisor.
	</para>
	<para>
	  A big warning needs to be issued though : if you change a
	  peer at run-time (after parsing programs),
	  you need to reload all the programs, functions,
	  state contexts which use that peer so that they reference
	  the new peer and its C++ implementation.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Step 4 : Use the task's interface</title>
	<para>To make the example complete, here is an example
	script which could run in the supervisor task :
	</para>
	<programlisting>
  program ControlDevice
  {
     const int par1 = 0
     const int par2 = 1
     do device.setParameter(par1, supervisor.par1 )
     do device.setParameter(par2, supervisor.par2 )

     while ( device.getError() == 0 ) 
     {
	if ( this.updateDevice("device") == true )
           do device.updateData() until {
	        if done || ( device.getError() != 0 ) then
	           continue
	   }
     }
     do this.handleError("device", device.getError() )
  }</programlisting>
	<para>To start this program from the TaskBrowser, browse to supervisor
	  and type the command :</para>
	<screen>
  ControlDevice.start()
	</screen>
	<para>
	  When  the program "ControlDevice" is started,
	  it initialises some parameters from its own attributes.
	  Next, the program goes into a loop and sends updateData commands
	  to the device as long as underlying supervisor (i.e. "this") logic requests
	  an update and no error is reported. This code guarantees that
	  no two updateData commands will intervene each other since the
	  program waits for the commands completion or error.
	  When the device returns
	  an error, the supervisor can then handle the error of the
	  device and restart the program if needed.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The advantages of this program over classical C/C++ functions are :
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If any error occurs (i.e. a command or method returns false),
	    the program stops and other programs or state contexts can
	    detect this and take appropriate action.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The  "<function>device.updateData()</function>" call waits
	    for completion of the remote command, but can be given other
	    completion or error conditions to watch for.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>While the program waits for <function>updateData()</function>
	      to complete, it does not block other programs, etc within
	      the same TaskContext and thread.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      There is no need for additional synchronisation primitives
	      between the supervisor and the device since the commands
	      are queued and executed in the thread of the device, which
	      leads to :
	    </para>
	    <itemizedlist>
	      <listitem>
		<para>The command is executed at the priority of the device's
		  thread, and not the supervisor's priority.</para>
	      </listitem>
	      <listitem>
		<para>The command can never corrupt data of the device's thread,
		  since it is <emphasis>serialised</emphasis>(executed after)
		  with the programs running in that thread.
		</para>
	      </listitem>
	    </itemizedlist>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
