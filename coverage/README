Test phase
==========

* Only the percentage of the "*.cxx" files coverage is taken into account

* The countless .gcov for headers are ignored for html output (but generated)
  Since a lot of code is in headers (templates) a lot of files are ignored

* gcov does not handle well template code: tags it as 'not executable' in
  .gcov listings.

* gcov overwrites existing .gcov files, need to use the -l flag to avoid that,
  which prefixes the .gcov file with the source file calling it, but even then,
  DataSource.hpp occurs twice in Orocos.

* gcov does not generate data for .o files like PropertyBase.o in GCC 4.0.
  if the .o file contains no code, then the .hpp.gcov file contains the relevant
  source listing.
