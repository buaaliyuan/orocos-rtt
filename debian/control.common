Description: Orocos Real-Time Toolkit common development files
 Orocos (http://www.orocos.org) is the acronym of the
 Open Robot Control Software project. The project's aim is to develop
 a general-purpose, free software, and modular framework
 for robotand machine control.
 The Orocos project supports 4 C++ libraries: the Real-Time Toolkit, the
 Kinematics and Dynamics Library, the Bayesian Filtering Library and
 the Orocos Component Library.
 .
 The Orocos Real-Time Toolkit (RTT) is not an application
 in itself, but it provides the infrastructure and the
 functionalities to build robotics applications in C++. The
 emphasis is on real-time, online interactive and
 component based applications.
 .
 This package provides the RTT library.
