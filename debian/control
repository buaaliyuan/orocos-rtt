Description: Orocos Real-Time Toolkit development files
      Orocos (http://www.orocos.org) is the acronym of the
      Open Robot Control Software project. The project's aim is to develop
      a general-purpose, free software, and modular framework
      for robotand machine control.
      The Orocos project supports 4 C++ libraries: the Real-Time Toolkit, the
      Kinematics and Dynamics Library, the Bayesian Filtering Library and
      the Orocos Component Library.
      .
      The Orocos Real-Time Toolkit (RTT) is not an application
      in itself, but it provides the infrastructure and the
      functionalities to build robotics applications in C++. The
      emphasis is on real-time, online interactive and
      component based applications.
      .
      This package provides the headers for developing Orocos applications.
