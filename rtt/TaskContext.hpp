     * The TaskContext is the C++ representation of an Orocos component.
     * It defines which services it provides and requires and which ports are inputs and
     * outputs. It can be configured through the means of properties.
     *
     * @par TaskContext interface
     * You can define the interface of a TaskContext by adding interface primitives.
     * These are (data flow) ports, (configuration) properties and operations (functions).
     * Setting up the interface is explained at length in the Orocos Component Builder's
     * Manual.
     *
     * @par TaskContext state behaviour
     * When a TaskContext is created it defaults to the 'Stopped' state or
     * the 'PreOperational' state. If it is 'Stopped', it can be start()'ed. If it is 'PreOperational',
     * it must first be configure()'d before it can be started. You can choose
     * between both using the constructor.
     * @see TaskState (in base::TaskCore) for a detailed explanation.
     *
     * @par Executing a TaskContext
     * In order to run the ExecutionEngine, the ExecutionEngine must
     * be run by an base::ActivityInterface implementation. As long as
     * there is no activity or the activity is not started, this
     * TaskContext will not accept any asynchronous invocations,
     * nor execute programs or state machines.
     *
     * @par Connecting TaskContexts
     * TaskContexts are connected using the unidirectional addPeer() or bidirectional
     * RTT::connectPeers() methods. These methods only allow
     * 'peer' TaskContexts to use each other's interface. Use RTT::connectPorts()
     * to setup the data connections between data ports.
     * In order to disconnect this task from its peers, use disconnect(), which
     * will disconnect all the Data Flow Ports and remove this object from its
     * Peers.
     *
     * In day-to-day use, TaskContexts are connected using the OCL::DeploymentComponent
     * and an XML file or script.
