This subdirectory follows the conventions of:

- R. Featherstone, ``Position and Velocity Transformations between Robot
  End-Effector Coordinates and Joint Angles'', International Journal of
  Robotics Research, Vol. 2, No. 2, pp. 35-45, 1983, and

- K. H. Low and R. N. Dubey, ``A Comparative Study on Generalized Coordinates
  for Solving the Inverse-Kinematics Problem of a 6R Robot Manipulator,''
  International Journal of Robotics Research, Vol. 5, No. 4, pp. 69-88, 1986.

The subdirectories `ZX...' contain the kinematic routines for 6R robots with
the corresponding construction. E.g. ZXXZXZ indicates the robot family with
the first joint rotating about its Z axis, the second about its X axis, the
third about its X axis, and so on.
`ZXXDWH' is the family of robots which are functionally equivalent to the ZXXZXZ
robots, but which have a `Dubbel Winkel Hand' wrist (with four joints, two of
which are coupled mechanically).

The `Off' and `Ecc' extensions indicate that the robots in this family have
a shoulder offset, or a shoulder offset AND an arm eccentricity.
