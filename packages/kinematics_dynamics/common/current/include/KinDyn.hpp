/**
 * @brief This namespace contains all classes of the kinematics_dynamics package.
 *
 * It is meant to group all packages which provide kinematic and 
 * dynamic algorithms. The algorithms are state-less and need all
 * information passed through the parameters. The KinematicComponent
 * uses these algorithms to provide a state-full component which
 * keeps track of the current configuration and position, velocities etc.
 *
 * kinematics_dynamics is documented in <a href="../../../orocos-kinematics.html">
 * The Orocos Kinematics and Dynamics Online Manual</a>
