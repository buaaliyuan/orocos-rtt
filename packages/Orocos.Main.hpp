/**
 * @mainpage Orocos Online API Documentation
 * 
 * @section intro Introduction
 * This is the Online API documentation of all available
 * packages in Orocos. Not necessarily all files listed
 * here are installed on your system. The Orocos
 * Documentation web page on the main site contains links
 * to individual packages (which still contains cross
 * references to others).
 *
 * @section recom Recommendation
 * It is easiest to browse the classes by namespace, to not
 * loose the overview. Click for example on the <tt>Namespace List</tt>
 * link, select a namespace and then you get all the classes
 * defined within this namespace. At the bottom of that page,
 * you'll find a more elaborate description of the namespace.
 *
 * You will most likely also need to read the online manuals.
