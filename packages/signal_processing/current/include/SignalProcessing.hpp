/**
 * @brief This is the main namespace of the signal_processing package. 
 *
 * It groups all classes that are meant for signal generation and processing.
 * A signal is represented by a double, and signals are proccessed in a
 * channel.
 * It is handy for testing hardware setups, an Orocos Control Kernel
 * can be used for complexer control tasks. The FeedForwardController,
 * GenericSensor, GenericEffector and SignalGenerator Components use
 * this library.
 *
 * Orocos is in the need of attracking an external signal processing library.
 *
 * @see ORO_ControlKernel
 *
 * This package is not yet documented inb an Orocos Manual.
