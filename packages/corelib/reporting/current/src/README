Reporting
---------

Reporting is defined as the act of collecting data of a running system
on specific, periodic time instances and making the data available
for an external party. The format in which the data is presented is of
no importance, but a specific implementation will choose to export
the reports in string format or other common data formats like properties.

The so called Report Clients thus periodically collect timestamped data.

Clients - Acceptors
-------

A Report Client collects reports from its clients in a specified data
format. This format may or may not be the same as the data format in
which the Client exports the data. For example it may collect data records
as PropertyBags and export it through a GUI showing a scrolling chart.

Servers - Exporters
-------

The Report Exporter serves the data to the client in the requested format.
It handles internal data in such a way that it becomes managable for the
clients purposes. It must collect data on the clients request and stamp
it with a timestamp given by the client. The client can than later on
collect the acquired data for further processing. Exporters keep no
history of data records (yet).
