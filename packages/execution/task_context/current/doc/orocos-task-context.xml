      A task is a basic unit of functionality which executes one or more (realtime)
      programs in a single thread. 
      The program can vary from a mere C function over a realtime program script
      to a realtime hierarchical state machine. The focus is completely on 
      thread-safe time determinism. Meaning, that the system is free of priority-inversions,
      and all operations are lock-free (also data sharing and other forms of communication
      such as events and commands). This is done using the mechanisms of the &orocos;
      Real-Time CoreLib which allows each task to run in its own thread or share
      threads. Real-Time tasks can communicate with non Real-Time tasks (and vice versa)
      transparantly.

    <title>Setting Up a Basic Task</title>
    <para>
      Tasks are rather simple entities in &orocos; and are
      implemented by the <classname>TaskContext</classname> class,
      which should not be confused with the CoreLib periodic Task
      implementations.
      It is useful speaking of a context because it defines
      the context in which the task operates. 
      It defines the interface of the task, its attributes,
      its peer tasks and uses a 
      <classname>Processor</classname> to handle its
      programs and to accept commands from other tasks.
    </para>
    <para>
      A <classname>TaskContext</classname> is constructed as :
    </para>
    <para>
      <programlisting>
  #include &lt;execution/Processor.hpp&gt;
  #include &lt;execution/TaskContext.hpp&gt;

  // we assume this is done in all the following code listings :
  using namespace ORO_Execution;

  Processor   a_processor, b_processor;
  TaskContext a_task("ATask", &amp;a_processor);
  TaskContext b_task("BTask", &amp;b_processor);

  // task creates own (default) Processor :
  TaskContext c_task("CTask");
      </programlisting>
    </para>
    <para>
      The first argument is the (unique) name of the task,
      the second argument is its <classname>Processor</classname>, 
      which is optional. If none is given, the Processor will
      be constructed (and deleted) by the TaskContext itself.
    </para>
    <para>
      A task's interface consists of : Commands,
      Methods, DataSources and Attributes, which are all public.
      We will refer to them as members.
      The TaskContext exports the members (to other tasks)
      by means of object factories.
      Which members are exported is up to the application. Upon
      construction, all factories are empty. A task factory hosts
      object factories, that is, a TaskContext contains
      objects, which have Commands, Methods and/or DataSources,
      which all map to the C++ functions or variables of the task.

      <title>The Method Factory</title>
      <para>
	The easiest way to access a TaskContext's interface
	is through Methods. They resemble very much normal C
	or C++ functions. They take arguments and return a value.
	The return value can in return be used as an argument
	for other Methods or stored in a variable. For
	all details, we refer to the &orocos; Program Parser
	Manual.
      </para>
      <para>
	To add a method to the Method Factory, one can use
	the <classname>TemplateMethodFactory</classname>,
	to easily create method factories :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  #include &lt;execution/TemplateFactories.hpp&gt;

  class ClassX
  {
    public:
    void reset() { ... }
    string getName() { ... }
    double changeParameter(double f) { ... }
    // ...
  };

  ClassX xobj;

  TemplateMethodFactory&lt;ClassX&gt;* fact =
    newMethodFactory( &amp;xobj );
  fact-&gt;add( &quot;reset&quot;,
             method( &amp;ClassX::reset, &quot;Reset the system.&quot; ) );
  fact-&gt;add( &quot;name&quot;,
             method( &amp;ClassX::getName,
                     &quot;Read out the name of the system.&quot; ) );
  fact-&gt;add( &quot;changeP&quot;,
             method( &amp;ClassX::changeParameter,
                     &quot;Change a parameter, return the old value.&quot;,
	             &quot;New Value&quot;, &quot;The new value for the parameter.&quot; ) ); 

  a_task.methodFactory.registerObject("objname", fact);	</programlisting>
      </para>
      <para>
	The first statement 
	<programlisting>
  TemplateMethodFactory&lt;ClassX&gt;* fact =
    newMethodFactory( &amp;xobj );
	</programlisting>
	constructs a new TemplateMethodFactory, which will create methods
	for the <emphasis>object</emphasis> 'xobj'. A TemplateMethodFactory
	only provides access to one C++ object. 
	After this factory is constructed, we add
	methods to it using the add() function.  The add() function requires a
	name for the added method, and information on the method to be
	associated with that name.  The latter is generated using the
	function method().
      </para>
      <programlisting>
  fact-&gt;add( &quot;reset&quot;,
             method( &amp;ClassX::reset, &quot;Reset the system.&quot; ) );</programlisting>
      <para>
	The <function>method()</function> function requires a pointer to a
	class function having a number of
	arguments, and returning the appropriate result.  The function's
	signature will automatically define the signature in the
	exported API.  After the class function pointer follows a C
	string containing a description of the function, followed by a
	name and description for each of the arguments.
      </para>
<programlisting>
  a_task.methodFactory.registerObject("objname", fact);	</programlisting>
      <para>
	Finally, the factory is stored in the method interface of a_task,
	where it is <emphasis>added</emphasis> to the "objname" methods.
	Using this mechanism, any method of any class can be added to a task's
	method interface. All methods are grouped in an object
	namespace ( here &quot;objname&quot; ), which can be served
	by different classes ( and thus factories ). To invoke this
	method from a script, one can then write :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  ATask.objname.changeP( 0.1 )	</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	If the method should
	belong to the task's interface without an object, the
	&quot;this&quot; object name may be given instead
	of &quot;objname&quot;. Applied to the
	above factory, this would result in :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  ATask.changeP( 0.1 )  </programlisting></para>
      <para>
      </para>
      <para>
	Any number of methods and objects can be added to a
	TaskContext. Also the methods of the TaskContext
	itself (or its derived classes) may be added. The
	added methods keep their polymorphism, meaning that
	<emphasis>
	  you may add pure virtual methods to the factory.

	      The "this" object stores the task's members.

    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>The Attribute Repository</title>
      <para>
	A TaskContext may have any number of attributes,
	of any type. They can be used by programs in the
	TaskContext to get (and set) configuration data.
      </para>
      <para>
	An attribute can be added in the task's
	<classname>AttributeRepository</classname> like this :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  a_task.attributeRepository.addAttribute( "aflag", bool(false) );
  a_task.attributeRepository.addAttribute( "max",   int(5) );</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	Which inserts an attribute of type bool and int, name 'aflag' and 'max' and initial
	value of false and 5 to the task's repository.
	When a duplicate name entry is added (even of a different type),
	the old one is removed. To get a value from the repository,
	you can use :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  TaskAttributeBase* attr = a_task.attributeRepository.getValue( "max" );</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	But it is more usefull to access attributes from a program
	script, which is explained lateron.
      </para>
      <para>
	You can also add constants, which can then no longer be
	changed :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  a_task.attributeRepository.addConstant( "pi", double(3.14) );</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	You should again be careful for duplicate entries.
      </para>
      <para>
	A program script can access the above attributes as in</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>  // a program in "ATask" does :
  var double pi2 = task.pi * 2.
  var int    myMax = 3
  set task.max = myMax	

  // an external (peer task) program does :
  var double pi2 = ATask.pi * 2.
  var int    myMax = 3
  set ATask.max = myMax	</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	When trying to assign a value to a constant, the script parser
	will throw an exception, thus before the program is run.
	You must always specify the task's name (or 'task') when accessing a
	task's attribute, this is different from methods and commands,
	which may omit the task's name if the program is running within
	the task.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>The Command Factory</title>
      <para>
	The next factory we discuss is the Command Factory,
	which produces C++ <classname>CommandInterface</classname>
	objects which encapsulate a command call to a TaskContext's
	interface. The philosophy behind commands is explained
	in the CoreLib, which defines the CommandInterface and
	in the Program Parser and Processor manuals, which 
	provide easy to use implementations of this interface.
      </para>
      <para>
	To add a command to the Command Factory, one can use
	the <classname>TemplateCommandFactory</classname>,
	to easily create command factories :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  #include &lt;execution/TemplateFactories.hpp&gt;

  class ClassX
  {
    public:
    bool startCycle() { ... }
    bool cycleDone() const { ... }

    bool cleanupMess(double f) { ... }
    bool isMessCleaned() { ... }
    // ...
  };

  Class_X x_obj;
  TemplateCommandFactory&lt;Class_X&gt;* fact =
    newCommandFactory( &amp;x_obj );
  fact-&gt;add( &quot;startCycle&quot;, 
            command( &amp;Class_X::startCycle,
                     &amp;Class_X::cycleDone,
                     &quot;Start a new cycle.&quot; ) );
  fact-&gt;add( &quot;cleanup&quot;,
            command( &amp;Class_X::cleanupMess,
                     &amp;Class_X::isMessCleaned,
                     &quot;Start cleanup operation.&quot;,
	             &quot;factor&quot;, &quot;A factor denoting the thoroughness.&quot; ) );

  a_task.commandFactory.registerObject("objname", fact);</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	Commands differ from Methods in that they take
	an extra function which is called the Completion
	Condition. It is a function which returns true
	when the command is done. The command itself
	also returns a boolean which indicates if it 
	was accepted or not. Reasons to be rejected
	can be faulty arguments or that the system
	is not ready to accept a new command.
      </para>
      <programlisting>
  fact-&gt;add( &quot;startCycle&quot;, 
            command( &amp;Class_X::startCycle,
                     &amp;Class_X::cycleDone,
                     &quot;Start a new cycle.&quot; ) );</programlisting>
      <para>
	Thus the <function>command()</function> function
	requires two member pointers instead of
	one.  The first one is a function that does the actual work
	that the command will invoke, and the second is a bool
	<emphasis>const</emphasis> function having :</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>the same arguments as the first one,</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>OR only the first argument as the first one,</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>OR no arguments at all.</para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
	The second function (the completion condition)
	will be called to see whether the
	associated command is finished.  The rest of the arguments to
	the command function remain the same.  It also requires a
	constant C string describing the function, and two constant C
	strings giving a description and name for every argument.
      </para>
      <para>
	The above lets you write in a program script :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  do objname.startCycle()
  do objname.cleanupMess( 0.1 )	</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	when the program is loaded in a_task.
      </para>
      <para>
	Commands returning false will propagate that error
	to the program or function calling that command, which
	will cause the program to enter an error state, ie
	it stops its execution.
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>The DataSource Factory</title>
      <para>
	DataSources are read-only objects which, when evaluated,
	return some data. The source of the data can be anything,
	as long as it takes finite time to get it. DataSources
	can be combined to new DataSources using algorithmic
	expressions. The only way they differ from Methods, is
	that the corresponding C++ function must be const.
      </para>
      <para>
	To add a method to the DataSource Factory, one can use
	the <classname>TemplateDataSourceFactory</classname>,
	to easily create DataSource factories :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  #include &lt;execution/TemplateFactories.hpp&gt;

  class ClassX
  {
    public:
    int _number;
    string getName() const { ... }
    double power(double a, double b) const {}
    // ...
  };

  ClassX xobj;

  TemplateDataSourceFactory&lt;ClassX&gt;* fact =
    newDataSourceFactory( &amp;xobj );
  fact-&gt;add( &quot;number&quot;,
            data( &amp;ClassX::_number,
                  &quot;the number.&quot; ) );
  fact-&gt;add( &quot;name&quot;,
            data( &amp;ClassX::getName,
                  &quot;Read out the name.&quot; ) );
  fact-&gt;add( &quot;power&quot;,
            data( &amp;ClassX::power,
                  &quot;return a to the power of b&quot;,
	          &quot;a&quot;, &quot;the base&quot;, 
	          &quot;b&quot;, &quot;the exponent&quot; ) ); 

  a_task.datasourceFactory.registerObject("objname", fact);	</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	which is dus nearly identical to using a method.
	Notice the usage of the _number class member. The
	factory also accepts class member variables instead
	of const functions, but likewise, they are also
	read-only.
	The braces are optional when no arguments must be
	given :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  var int nb = objname.number
  var double result = objname.power( 5., 6.)</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	Again, the &quot;this&quot; object can be used if the 
	DataSource should belong to the task's interface.

      <title>Creating Commands Without the Factories</title>

	It is possible to create a command without the

    <title>Connecting Tasks</title>
    <para>
      A Real-Time system contains multiple concurrent
      tasks which must communicate to each other.
      TaskContext objects can be connected to each other
      so that they can communicate Real-Time data or commands.
      We call them &quot;Peers&quot; as there is no fixed
      hierarchy. A connection from one TaskContext to its
      Peer can be uni- or bi-directional. In a uni-directional
      connection, only one peer can send commands to the other, while
      in a bi-directional connection, both can send each other
      commands.
    </para>
    <para>
      Peers are connected as such (<methodname>hasPeer</methodname> takes a string 
      argument ):</para>

      This allows to build strictly hierarchical topological

    </para>
    <para>
      From within a program script, peers can be accessed by
      merely prefixing their name to the member you want to
      access. A program within &quot;ATask&quot; could
      access its peers as such :</para>

    <title>Running Tasks</title>
    <para>
      A TaskContext receives its commands from its Processor.
      The Processor will check periodically for new commands
      in it's queue
      and execute programs which are running in the task.
      Thus to start the task, one needs to start the Processor.
      As long as it is not started, it will accept no commands
      and run no programs.
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Starting Periodic Task Execution</title>
      <para>
	To run a Processor, you need to use one of the Periodic

	Which will start the processor of ATask with a timer frequency
	of 1kHz. This is the frequency at which state machines are
	evaluated, program steps taken and commands are accepted

	are stopped, state machines are brought into the final state and
	no more commands are accepted.

    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Task Program Scripts</title>
      <para>
	Commands are a Real-Time means of communication between tasks.
	They are asynchronous method calls from one task to another,
	without caring for multi-threaded locking issues.
	A command can be rejected if the other task is not running, which 
	can be detected by the sending task.
      </para>
      <para>
	Commands can 
	be grouped into Orocos Program Scripts (ops), which allow
	programs to be loaded at runtime into a task. The

      <sect3 id="task-context-functions">
	<title>Functions</title>
	<para>
	  A function is formed by a group of commands and

	  available as a task's command ( which will fail
	  if one of its contained commands fail ) :
	  <programlisting>  do ATask.myFun( 1, 2)</programlisting>
	  If you omit the export keyword, then the function will not
	  become available as a command. To use a not exported function, you need to 
	  execute it in the Processor ( see below ), or call it in a program,
	  which was parsed in the same file (see <xref linkend="task-context-programs" /> ).
	</para>
	<para>
	  Functions must be parsed by the <classname>Parser</classname>,

	<title>Requesting States</title>
	<para>
	  A State Machine can be used such that it waits for state
	  change requests instead of discovering itself to which 
	  state it makes a transition. This requires the State Machine to run in
	  another mode, the requestState mode ( as opposed to the steppingState mode,
	  which is entered by start() ). 
	</para>
	<programlisting>
  StateMachine X {
     // ...
     state y {
        entry {
	   // ...
        }
        transitions {
	   // guard this transition.
           if task.checkSomeCondition() then
              select z
	   // always good to go to states :
	   select ok_1
           select ok_2
        }
     }
     state z {
       // ...
     }
     state ok_1 {
       // ...
     }
     state ok_2 {
       // ...
     }
  }

  RootMachine X x</programlisting>
	<para>Then, load an ops file which contains :</para>
	<programlisting>
  export function progress() {
       // request to enter anther state :
       do this.states.x.requestState("z")
    }
  export function progress_Ok() {
       // this will succeed always from state 'x' :
       do this.states.x.requestState("ok1")
    } </programlisting>
         <para>
	   This command will fail if the transition is not 
	   possible ( for example, the state machine is not in
	   state y, or task.checkSomeCondition() was not true ),
	   otherwise, the state machine will make the transition
	   and the command succeeds and completes when the z state
	   is fully entered (it's init program completed).
	 </para>
	 <para>
	   To merely request that a state is handled, one can
	   call requestState on the current state :
	 </para>
	<programlisting>
  export function progress() {
       // request to handle current state :
       do this.states.x.requestState( this.states.x.getState() )
    }  </programlisting>
	 <para>
	   To request to go to the next possible state (or call handle if
	   none) and then wait again for requests, use 'step()' :
	 </para>
	<programlisting>
  export function progress() {
       // request go to the next state and wait :
       do this.states.x.step()
    }  </programlisting>
         <para>
	   Note that if the StateMachine happened to be paused, step() would
	   only progress one single statement. To check if the StateMachine
	   is waiting for requests, use the 'inRequest()' method :
	 </para>
	<programlisting>
  export function progress() {
       if ( this.states.x.inRequest() ) {
           // ... it's waiting
       } else {
          // was not waiting, possibly running, paused or non active
       }
    }  </programlisting>
        <para>
	  All these methods can of course also be called from parent
	  to child State Machine, or across tasks.

      <title>Polymorphism : Task Interfaces</title>
      <para>
	Most projects have define their own task interfaces in C++.
	Assume you have a class with the following interface :
      </para>
      <programlisting>
  class DeviceInterface
  {
  public:
    /**
     * Set/Get a parameter. Returns false if parameter is read-only.
     */
    virtual bool setParameter(int parnr, double value) = 0;
    virtual double getParameter(int parnr) const = 0;

    /**
     * Get the newest data.
     * Return false on error.
     */
    virtual bool updateData() = 0;
    virtual bool updated() const = 0;

    /**
     * Get Errors if any.
     */
    virtual int getError() const = 0;
  };</programlisting>
      <para>
	Now suppose you want to do make this interface available,
	such that program scripts of other tasks can access this 
	interface. Because you have many devices, you surely want
	all of them to be accessed transparantly from a supervising
	task. Luckily for you, C++ polymorphism can be transparantly
	adopted in Orocos TaskContexts. This is how it goes.
      </para>
      <sect3>
	<title>Step 1 : Export the interface</title>
	<para>We construct a TaskContext, which exports your
	C++ interface to a task's interface.
	</para>
	<programlisting>
  #include &lt;execution/TaskContext.hpp&gt;
  #include &lt;execution/TemplateFactories.hpp&gt;
  #include "DeviceInterface.hpp"

  class TaskDeviceInterface
    : public DeviceInterface,
      public TaskContext
  {
  public:
      TaskDeviceInterface()
        : TaskContext( "DeviceInterface" )
      {
         this->setup();
      }

      void setup() 
      {
         // Add Methods :
         TemplateMethodFactory&lt;DeviceInterface&gt;* mfact =

	                   &quot;Parameter&quot;, &quot;The number of the parameter.&quot;,
	                   &quot;New Value&quot;, &quot;The new value for the parameter.&quot;)); 
         this->methodFactory.registerObject("this", mfact);

         dfact-&gt;add( &quot;getParameter&quot;,
                     data(&amp;DeviceInterface::getParameter,
	                  &quot;Get a device parameter.&quot;,
                          &quot;Parameter&quot;, &quot;The number of the parameter.&quot;));

                                 &quot;Command data acquisition.&quot; ) );
         this->commandFactory.registerObject("this", cfact);
      }
  };</programlisting>
	<para>
	  The above listing just combines all factories which were introduced
	  in the previous sections. Also note that the TaskContext's name
	  is fixed to "DeviceInterface". This is not obligatory though.

      </sect3>
      <sect3>
	<title>Step 2 : Inherit from the new interface</title>
	<para>Your DeviceInterface implementations now
	  only need to inherit from <classname>TaskDeviceInterface</classname>
	  to instantiate a Device TaskContext :
	</para>
	<programlisting>
  #include "TaskDeviceInterface.hpp"

  class MyDevice_1 
    : public TaskDeviceInterface
  {
  public:

    bool setParameter(int parnr, double value) {
      // ...
    }
    double getParameter(int parnr) const {      // ...
    }
    // etc.
  };
	</programlisting>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
	<title>Step 3 : Add the task to other tasks</title>
	<para>
	  The new TaskContext can now be added to other tasks.
	  If needed, an alias can be given such that the
	  peer task knows this task under another name.
	  This allows the user to access different incarnations
	  of the same interface from a task.
	</para>
	<programlisting>
	  // now add it to the supervising task :
  MyDevice_1 mydev;
  supervisor.addPeer( &amp;mydev, "device" );
	</programlisting>
	<para>
	  From now on, the "supervisor" task will be able to access
	  "device". If the implementation changes, the same interface
	  can be reused whithout changing the programs in the supervisor.
	</para>
	<para>
	  A big warning needs to be issued though : if you change a
	  peer at runtime (after parsing programs),
	  you need to reload all the programs, functions,
	  state contexts which use that peer so that they reference
	  the new peer and its C++ implementation.
	</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
	<title>Step 4 : Use the task's interface</title>
	<para>To make the example complete, here is an example
	script which could run in the supervisor task :
	</para>
	<programlisting>
  program ControlDevice
  {
     const int par1 = 0
     const int par2 = 1
     do device.setParameter(par1, supervisor.par1 )
     do device.setParameter(par2, supervisor.par2 )

     while ( device.getError() == 0 ) 
     {
	if ( this.updateDevice("device") == true )
           do device.updateData() until {
	        if done || ( device.getError() != 0 ) then
	           continue
	   }
     }
     do this.handleError("device", device.getError() )
  }</programlisting>
	<para>To start this program from the TaskBrowser, browse to supervisor
	  and type the command :</para>
	<screen>
  device.programs.ControlDevice.start()
	</screen>
	<para>
	  When  the program "ControlDevice" is started,
	  it initialises some parameters from its own attributes.
	  Next, the program goes into a loop and sends updateData commands
	  to the device as long as underlying supervisor (ie "this") logic requests
	  an update and no error is reported. This code guarantees that
	  no two updateData commands will intervene each other since the
	  program waits for the commands completion or error.
	  When the device returns
	  an error, the supervisor can then handle the error of the
	  device and restart the program if needed.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The advantages of this program over classical C/C++ functions are :
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>If any error occurs (ie a command or method returns false),
	    the program stops and other programs or state contexts can
	    take apropriate action.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The  "<function>device.updateData()</function>" call waits
	    for completion of the remote command, but can be given other
	    completion or error conditions to watch for.</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>While the program waits for <function>updateData()</function>

	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      There is no need for additional synchronisation primitives
	      between the supervisor and the device since the commands
	      are queued and executed in the thread of the device, which
	      leads to :

	    <itemizedlist>

      <title>Sending a Task a Command</title>
      <para>
	To request a command from one task to another task, the command must
	be fetched from the factories and next passed to the
	TaskContext which has two methods to accept commands.
	In a C++ program, this would be : </para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  TaskContext* peer = this->getPeer("ATask");

  // Create the command argument list :
  std::vector&lt;DataSourceBase*&gt; args;
  args.push_back( new DataSource&lt;double&gt;(0.1) );

  // Create the command and condition :
  ComCon comcon =
     peer->commandFactory.getObjectFactory("objname")->
	     create("cleanupMess", args );

  // Execute the command :
  if ( peer->executeCommand( comcon.first ) ==  false ) {
       // Error !
  }

  // wait until done :
  while ( comcon.second->evaluate() == false )
     sleep(1);
  // command done, we can now delete it or keep it.	</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	The factory can throw exceptions if the number of arguments,
	the type of arguments or the command names are unknown.
	It returns a <classname>ComCon</classname> struct, where the
	<varname>first</varname> member contains a pointer to the
	CommandInterface and the <varname>second</varname> member
	contains a pointer to the ConditionInterface ( the Completion
	Condition ).
	<methodname>executeCommand</methodname> will always execute
	the command, no matter if the processor is running or not.
	If it is not running, the command is directly executed and
	the return value of the command is returned (true or false).
	If the processor is running, the command is queued and you
	have no direct way to know what the return value is ( No panic, 
	a solution is presented lateron !)
	The alternative is <methodname>queueCommand</methodname>,
	which will only queue if the Processor is running :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  // ... see previous listing
  int qnb = peer->queueCommand( comcon.first );
  if ( qnb == 0 ) {
	// Error, not accepted !
  }
  while ( !peer->getProcessor()->isProcessed( qnb ) )
        sleep(1); // wait until the command is processed

  while ( comcon.second->evaluate() == false )
        sleep(1); // wait until the command is done
  // command done, we can now delete it or keep it.	</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	Again, you only know if it got in the queue, but not
	if it was accepted by the task itself, meaning, if the
	command returned true. 
      </para>
    </sect2>
    <sect2>
      <title>Advanced Command Queueing</title>
      <para>
	The previous section showed how a command can be given to
	a task, but the return value of the Command was lost.
	In some cases, this does not matter, but when the
	program logic needs to know the result, two options
	are possible. One can write a program script, which
	check command return values (and go into error if
	the command fails) or wrap the command in a TryCommand.
	The next sections will discuss the first and easiest
	option. This sections discusses the second and thoughest
	option. If you intend to use mainly scripts (or get
	really confused), please skip this section.
      </para>
      <para>
	Assume you have a command,condition pair as above :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  ComCon comcon = ...;	</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	Before queueing, you can wrap both command and condition
	as such :</para>
      <para>
	<programlisting>
  #include &lt;execution/TryCommand.hpp&gt;
  // ...
  CommandInterface* trycommand
     = new TryCommand( comcon.first );

  DataSource&lt;bool&gt;* executed
     = trycommand.executed();
  DataSource&lt;bool&gt;* accepted 
     = trycommand.result();

  peer->queueCommand( trycommand );
  
  while ( executed->get() == false )
     sleep(1); // wait for its execution
  if ( accepted->get() == false ) {
     // Error, Command returned false !
  }
  while ( comcon.second->evaluate() == false )
     sleep(1); // wait for its completion	</programlisting></para>
      <para>
	The DataSources are used by the TryCommand to
	store the result into. We use the get() function
	to inspect the results.
