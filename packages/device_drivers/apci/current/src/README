This directory contains drivers for the apci DAQ PCI cards.

The module should compile with 2.4 and 2.6 kernels,
but the provided makefile assumes a 2.6 kernel.

You should edit the Makefile and change the values of KERNEL_DIR,
RTAI_INSTALL_DIR and OROCOS_INSTALL_DIR.

Then 'make driver' should build the driver.
