apci1710 v0.1

The apci1710 is a multifunction PCI counter card, manufactured by
ADDI-DATA. More information on the website: http://www.addi-data.com
and http://www.addi-data.com/e/apci1710.html.

This (partial completed) driver contains kernel level support for the
SSI (Synchronous Serial Interface) function. We're working at modules
for the other functions (like incremental counter, digital IO,...)

The TODO file contains more information about future development.
